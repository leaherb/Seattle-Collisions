# Seattle-Collisions

This project uses Seattle Collisions data* to compare 5 data analyst methods of cleaning, exploring and reporting data using Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

The motivation behind this project is two-fold:
1. practice wrangling, exploring and storytelling with data
2. identify commonalities, strengths and weaknesses of various toolsets used for wrangling, exploring and storytelling

### *Seattle Collisions Data
The [Seattle Collisions](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/collisions) dataset is a compilation of over 200,000 collision reports created by Seattle Police Department (SPD) that were then recorded by Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT), starting in 2004 and updated regularly.

## Project Status
This project a work in progress. The R method is actively being refined and will act as the standard against which the Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau modules will be developed.
